{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
Hi, I have joined the software testing team. You have been assigned my mentor. Can you please share some study material to start with?
{% include msgaltend.html %} 

{% include msgstart.html %} 
Welcome onboard! You don't need any study material to start with.
{% include msgend.html %} 

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
Then?
{% include msgaltend.html %} 

{% include msgstart.html %} 
God created testers first and then called them male and female 😀. 
{% include msgend.html %} 

{% include msgstart.html %} 
To start with, can you please list down different types of senses we have?
{% include msgend.html %} 

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
taste, touch, smell, hear, sight
{% include msgaltend.html %} 

{% include msgstart.html %} 
Good. Now, visualize one Gupta Jee in a sweet shop, tasting different flavors of barfis and then settling down for 250 gms of jalebi 😜. Isn’t that a very common example of testing using the sense of taste 😃?
{% include msgend.html %}

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
😄😁
{% include msgaltend.html %} 

{% include msgstart.html %} 
Now, think of a kid in a winter morning, touching the water in bucket to check if it’s too cold before taking bath. Sense of touch used for testing.
{% include msgend.html %}

{% include msgstart.html %} 
Here’s one for you. Imagine yourself at Shoppers Stop and trying different perfumes from samplers. Sense of smell used for testing
{% include msgend.html %}

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
So, I am already a tester 😇
{% include msgaltend.html %} 

{% include msgstart.html %} 
Yes, you are 😀.
{% include msgend.html %}

{% include msgstart.html %} 
Another one. Kids in a village putting their ear on railway track to hear any sound to ascertain if a train is coming. That’s sense of hearing used for testing.
{% include msgend.html %}

{% include msgstart.html %} 
And the last one 😀. Think of one Das babu in Kolkata looking at the sky 🧐, to check if it’s cloudy, to decide on taking an umbrella before going out. Sense of sight used for testing.
{% include msgend.html %}

{% include msgstart.html %} 
So, what do you say? Didn’t God actually create testers with these 5 sense organs?
{% include msgend.html %}

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
Yes, boss 👍. Perfect examples.
{% include msgaltend.html %} 

{% include msgstart.html %} 
It's your turn to come up with some more examples.
{% include msgend.html %}

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
OK, keeping in line with the examples shared earlier…here’s something that I have observed since childhood. Before going out, my father would put a big Godrej branded lock on the main door and he will pull the lock with lot of strength to make sure that it does not open up on pressure 😃.
{% include msgaltend.html %} 

{% include msgstart.html %} 
Oh yeah, that still hold true for most of us 😃. Great example. That’s like a mechanical product going through rigorous testing on daily basis.
{% include msgend.html %}

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
Here’s another one that I regularly do. Count the money after withdrawing money from a ATM machine and checking 🧐 correctness of amount of withdrawal and balance in the transaction slip
{% include msgaltend.html %} 

{% include msgstart.html %} 
There you go, 👍.
{% include msgend.html %}

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
Have you ever travelled by local train?
{% include msgaltend.html %}

{% include msgstart.html %} 
Yes, 🤔.
{% include msgend.html %}

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
Then you must remember checking the ticket for correctness of destination station, date of travel etc. Isn’t this also testing?
{% include msgaltend.html %}

{% include msgstart.html %} 
Yes, 👍.
{% include msgend.html %}

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
Now, something which has "Test" in it…<b>"Test Drive"</b> of vehicles. Even though we are more or less pre-decided about the brand and model, but we still take a test drive. Needless to say, we end up testing some of the features of the vehicle for sure.
{% include msgaltend.html %}

{% include msgstart.html %} 
😄😁
{% include msgend.html %}

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
And the last one for the day…who can forget testing by scribbling on paper/newspaper in a stationery shop with different pens before buying one.
{% include msgaltend.html %}

{% include msgstart.html %} 
Perfect, perfect. You have really put forward some great examples of product testing on day to day basis. Great going 👍.
{% include msgend.html %}

{% include msgstart.html %} 
A pictorial note on completing the session…😁.
