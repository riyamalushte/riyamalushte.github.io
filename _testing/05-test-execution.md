Now is the time to <b><i>execute</i></b> the test cases. Executing the test case means following:
<br><br>
(1.) fulfilling the <b><i>pre-conditions</i></b> by verifying or doing them manually 
<br><br>
(2.) Doing/Performing the <b><i>test steps</i></b> manually or using some device/tool as required
<br><br>
(3.) Noting down the <b><i>actual results</i></b> of the test steps performed
<br><br>
(4.) Comparing the <b><i>actual results</i></b> with the <b><i>expected results</i></b> of the test case. If the <b><i>actual results</i></b> match the <b><i>expected results</i></b>, the test case is declared <b><i>Passed</i></b>, otherwise <b><i>Failed</i></b>
<br><br>
(5.) If the test case fails, a <b><i>failure report</i></b> also known as <b><i>DEFECT</i></b> is written and presented to the responsible team for repair or corrective action.

{% include msgstart.html %} 
Another important aspect of test execution needs to be understood. Have you seen any kind of logs before?
{% include msgend.html %} 

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
Like call logs or call history in a mobile phone ü§î?
{% include msgaltend.html %} 

{% include msgstart.html %} 
Yes, pretty much the same üëç. What all information you can retrieve by looking at the call logs?
{% include msgend.html %} 

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
(1.) Caller or Called Party Id or number or contact name
<br><br>
(2.) Call Date, Time, duration
<br><br>
(3.) Call Status like Received, Missed or Outgoing Successful
{% include msgaltend.html %}

{% include msgstart.html %} 
Great üëç. Like call logs or call history, when we execute test cases, we need to maintain a <b>Test Execution Log</b>. 
{% include msgend.html %} 

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
How do we do that ü§î? What kind of tool we need to use to maintain a Test Execution Log?
{% include msgaltend.html %}

{% include msgstart.html %} 
In its simplest form an excel sheet with following columns can be used:
<br>
<table style="border: 1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse;">
<tr>
<td style="border: 1px solid black;"><b>TEST ID</b></td>
<td style="border: 1px solid black;"><b>DESCRIPTION</b></td>
<td style="border: 1px solid black;"><b>TEST DATE AND TIME</b></td>
<td style="border: 1px solid black;"><b>STATUS</b></td>
<td style="border: 1px solid black;"><b>DEFECT ID (IF ANY)</b></td>
</tr>
</table>
{% include msgend.html %}

{% include msgstart.html %} 
In professional environments, there are sophisticated software tools to maintain <i><b>Test Execution Logs</b></i> also known as <i><b>Test Cycles</b></i>. Some of the examples of tools used professionally are Test Link, Zephyr, HP Quality Centre, TestRail, TestLog etc.
{% include msgend.html %}

{% include msgaltstart.html %}
I heard about them earlier. They are called <b>Test Management Tools</b>.
{% include msgaltend.html %}

{% include msgstart.html %} 
üëèüëèüëè, correct.
