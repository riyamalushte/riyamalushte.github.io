Let‚Äôs take first few steps towards becoming a pro üòÅ.
{% include msgend.html %} 

{% include msgstart.html %} 
Please list down a few main features that you would like to test in a new mobile phone before purchasing.
{% include msgend.html %} 

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
(1.) Power on the phone, Switch Off the phone
{% include msgaltend.html %} 

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
(2.) Charge the phone
{% include msgaltend.html %} 

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
(3.) Make a call, Receive a call
{% include msgaltend.html %} 

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
(4.) Send SMS, Receive SMS
{% include msgaltend.html %} 

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
(5.) Connect to Internet
{% include msgaltend.html %} 

{% include msgstart.html %} 
Good, üëç. So, if any of the above features is not working, we will not accept the phone for purchase. That is the bare minimum testing we must do. This set of tests which covers the most important features is called set of <b>Sanity Tests</b> or <b>Smoke Tests</b>.
{% include msgend.html %} 

{% include msgstart.html %} 
Now list down a few features that are not most important but still helpful in operating the device.
{% include msgend.html %} 

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
(6.) Addition and Deletion of Contacts
{% include msgaltend.html %} 

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
(7.) Call logs or call history
{% include msgaltend.html %} 

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
(8.) Volume control
{% include msgaltend.html %} 

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
(9.) Bluetooth
{% include msgaltend.html %} 

{% include msgstart.html %} 
And there can be many more such things within a phone to test. The point here is, a comprehensive set of tests which includes all the features of a product, like the most important ones, less important ones etc., is called set of <b>Regression Tests</b>.
{% include msgend.html %} 

{% include msgstart.html %} 
Can you imagine anything to test the performance of the phone?
{% include msgend.html %} 

{% include msgaltstart.html %} 
(10.) Battery of the phone. If I listen to Music or watch videos on the phone, how long a fully charged battery lasts before we are required to charge it again. That‚Äôs an important parameter.
{% include msgaltend.html %} 

{% include msgstart.html %} 
And your 10th test is what we call <b>Performance Test</b> üòÅ
{% include msgend.html %}
