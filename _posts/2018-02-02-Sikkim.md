The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. The statement is a fact about Sikkim as it doesn’t lie in the hills and valleys rather in feelings. 

1. An Indian state but not by birth.

2. Maximum population of Sikkim has Nepalese origin, thus outnumbering the natives.

3. When the whole country prefers paying homage to the soldiers on a specific day or two, Sikkim has a temple built to honour a soldier.

4. As many as 11 languages are spoken in this tiny mountain state. 

5. Second highest suspension bridge in Asia is located in Sikkim. 

6. Sikkim’s state animal is the Red Panda—an endangered species.
